Social Network Analysis was used to identify and visualize co-authorship collaboration clusters, i.e. teams of scholars who carry out research with the use of games and ABMs, and publish the results together. Each author in a network is graphically represented as a node. The larger the nodes, the greater the number of publications a person authored. Links between two authors designate a co-authorship of the same publication. Thicker links denote a relationship between the first author and other writers.
